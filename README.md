# Generative Art

It all started with a Reddit post in which someone posted his book on generative art. I sent this to a friend ([Jonathan Lange](https://github.com/langej)) and we decided to start a challenge until Sunday (today the 10.07.2022). Who manages to generate a cool picture until Sunday.

Thus I find to research. Found videos and contributions without end to the topic generative art. One of the best sites I found was [Tim Holman](https://generativeartistry.com/tutorials/). Here you can try everything and learn interactively how to create the images. One of my first attempts was the image:

![index](resources/index.png)

I made it with the [tutorial](https://generativeartistry.com/tutorials/joy-division/) from Tim. And then it started to explore own things. Bringing my own variations into the pictures and designing my own. I played around a bit with triangles:

![triangle](resources/triangle.png)
![triangle smaller](resources/triangle_smaller_parts.png)

I also found it exciting to set points in circles:

![circle](resources/circle.png)

But what took me the most time was the image:

![hull](resources/hull.png)

It is based on the idea of the [tweet](https://twitter.com/mattdesl/status/945728391902265345/photo/4). I learned a lot about algorithms in 2D space. Also how to calculate if a point is in a surface, how straight lines work and how to vary the positions of points in space.

I can only recommend everyone to have a look at generative art and try something out. It's really fun and you can learn a lot about math and especially visualize it.

All code can be found on my [Github](https://github.com/auryn31/generative-art) as always. Here is the code in TypeScript and svelte to create your own images and modify existing ones.

## All Images

Examples of the images:

![boxes box](resources/boxes_box.png)
![boxes](resources/boxes.png)
![circle](resources/circle.png)
![hull](resources/hull.png)
![index](resources/index.png)
![lines lines](resources/lines_lines.png)
![lines](resources/lines.png)
![triangle](resources/triangle.png)
![mesh](resources/triangle_mesh.png)
![triangle smaller](resources/triangle_smaller_parts.png)
